*Problem Statement:*

This repository provides REST APIs to serve as the backend for the following product:

- A mobile app which allows a particular customer to upload the pic of PAN and AADHAAR and stores the data obtained by passing it through the OCR.
- Once the Above task is done, anyone can Read the custome's document data via a GET API

Language: Python
Framework: Django REST framework

At present the Project contains the customer app, with all the REST APIs for the resource Customer. The Design Pattern for the API versioning is already present.
